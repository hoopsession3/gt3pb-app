// THE one answer to "what day is it?" — the calendar audit found 'today' computed three ways
// (UTC slice, operator-local, calendar-local), so after ~8pm ET every UTC surface flipped to
// tomorrow: My Day greeted you with tomorrow's event, the drop checklist unfolded a night early.
// Two deliberate flavors, chosen by what the date MEANS:
// - localToday()/dayKey(): the OPERATOR's wall-clock day — crew-facing "today".
// - etToday()/etDayKey(): the BUSINESS day, pinned to America/New_York — commerce keys
//   (drop_date, delivery_date) that must not drift with the viewer's device timezone.
//   Same lesson lib/delivery.ts already learned; this makes it importable everywhere.
